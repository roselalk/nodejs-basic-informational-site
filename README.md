# Hello!

## Why did I do this project?
This is a super duper tiny practice project I did while doing the The Odin Project | NodeJS Course.


## What have I learned doing this project?
Before this project, I had never worked with creating a server in Node.js before, nor with any of the associated features.
But now I have!


## What would I like to learn after this project?
How to make the whole process in index.js easier and more efficient.
